            <p>We are composed of a group of highly skilled individuals, including business analysts and software
                developers. Together we have collaborated to build a tailored website to cater to the needs of our
                valued customers. Our carefully curated software enables us to give you precise predictions regarding
                the stock markets, giving you recommendations on which stocks to invest in or sell based on your
                requirements. By simply creating a StockMinder account, you can keep record of your previous activities
                and be notified when there is a change to your stocks. Our website is subdivided into helpful headers -
                our home page, the stocks and the help page. Our help page entails our contact details and any FAQs,
                reminding you of the fact that, here at StockMinder, we are always there for you. StockMinder
                specialises in the Banking, Energy, Metal and Agriculture sectors, through which you can refine your
                search. </p>
